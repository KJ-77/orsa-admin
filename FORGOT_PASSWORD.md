# Forgot Password Implementation

This implementation provides a complete forgot password flow for your Next.js application with AWS Cognito authentication.

## Features

- **Forgot Password Request**: Users can request a password reset by entering their email
- **Verification Code**: AWS Cognito sends a verification code to the user's email
- **Password Reset**: Users can set a new password using the verification code
- **Success Feedback**: Users receive confirmation messages throughout the process
- **Proper Navigation**: Seamless navigation between login, forgot password, and reset password pages

## Components Added

### 1. `ForgotPasswordForm` (`/src/components/forgot-password-form.tsx`)

- Handles the initial forgot password request
- Sends verification code to user's email via AWS Cognito
- Shows success message and guides user to next step

### 2. `ResetPasswordForm` (`/src/components/reset-password-form.tsx`)

- Handles the password reset with verification code
- Validates password strength and confirmation
- Redirects to login page with success message after reset

### 3. Updated `LoginForm` (`/src/components/login-form.tsx`)

- Added functional "Forgot your password?" link
- Shows success message after password reset
- Uses Suspense boundary for proper Next.js rendering

## Pages Added

### 1. `/forgot-password` page

- Route: `/forgot-password`
- Displays the forgot password form
- Redirects authenticated users to dashboard

### 2. `/reset-password` page

- Route: `/reset-password`
- Displays the password reset form
- Redirects authenticated users to dashboard

## Authentication Context Updates

Added two new methods to the `AuthContext`:

### `forgotPassword(email: string)`

- Sends password reset request to AWS Cognito
- Triggers email with verification code

### `resetPasswordConfirm(email: string, code: string, newPassword: string)`

- Confirms password reset with verification code
- Sets new password in AWS Cognito

## User Flow

1. **Login Page**: User clicks "Forgot your password?" link
2. **Forgot Password Page**: User enters email and submits
3. **Email Sent**: AWS Cognito sends verification code to email
4. **Reset Password Page**: User enters email, code, and new password
5. **Success**: User is redirected to login with success message
6. **Login**: User can now log in with new password

## AWS Cognito Configuration

The implementation uses the following AWS Amplify Auth methods:

- `resetPassword()`: Initiates password reset flow
- `confirmResetPassword()`: Confirms password reset with code

Make sure your AWS Cognito User Pool is configured to:

- Allow password reset via email
- Send verification codes via email
- Have proper email configuration (SES or Cognito email)

## Password Requirements

The reset password form enforces the same password requirements as defined in your Amplify configuration:

- Minimum 8 characters
- Contains uppercase letters
- Contains lowercase letters
- Contains numbers
- Contains special characters

## Error Handling

- Invalid email addresses
- Expired verification codes
- Invalid verification codes
- Password requirement violations
- Network/service errors

All errors are displayed with user-friendly messages and proper styling.

## Testing

To test the forgot password functionality:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Forgot your password?" on the login form
4. Enter a valid email address registered in your Cognito User Pool
5. Check your email for the verification code
6. Navigate to the reset password page (or click the link in the forgot password success message)
7. Enter email, verification code, and new password
8. Submit and verify you're redirected to login with success message
9. Test logging in with the new password

## Notes

- The verification code expires after a certain time (configurable in AWS Cognito)
- Users can request a new verification code by going through the forgot password flow again
- The implementation includes proper loading states and error handling
- All forms include accessibility features and proper validation
